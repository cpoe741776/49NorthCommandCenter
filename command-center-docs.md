## Component Details

### 1. Gmail Processing System

**Location:** Google Apps Script attached to Google Sheet  
**Main Script:** `processBidEmails()`

#### Core Functions

```javascript
setupBidScanner()           // One-time initialization
processBidEmails()          // Main processing (runs every 4 hours)
createAutomatedTrigger()    // Sets up automated scheduling
setOpenAIKey(apiKey)        // Securely stores OpenAI API key
testAIAnalysis()            // Test AI categorization
```

#### Processing Logic

1. **Email Retrieval**
   - Searches Gmail for unprocessed emails (last 7 days)
   - Extracts: Subject, From, Date, Body, Attachments
   - Batch limit: 50 emails per run

2. **Staging**
   - Writes to "Staging" tab in Google Sheet
   - Checks for duplicates by Email ID
   - Marks as "Not Processed"

3. **AI Analysis**
   - Sends email data to ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini model)
   - Provides company context and keyword categories
   - Receives: Recommendation, Reasoning, Extracted Data

4. **Categorization**
   - **"Respond"** → Active_Bids tab (high priority)
   - **"Gather More Information"** → Active_Bids tab (needs research)
   - **"Disregard"** → Disregarded tab + Gmail label

5. **Cleanup**
   - Deletes processed emails from Gmail
   - Moves disregarded emails to "Disregarded" label
   - Logs activity to Processing_Log tab

  BATCH_SIZE: 50,
  DAYS_TO_SEARCH: 7,

2. **Staging Check:** Email ID checked against existing rows
3. **Processed Flag:** "Processed" column prevents re-analysis
4. **Cross-Reference:** Email ID checked against Active_Bids and Disregarded tabs

#### Scheduling

**Automated Trigger:**
- Runs: Every 4 hours

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Bids Not Processing

**Symptoms:**
- No new bids in Active_Bids tab
- Processing_Log shows no recent activity
- Emails accumulating in Gmail

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check Processing_Log for errors
2. Open Apps Script → View → Execution log
3. Check trigger status: Edit → Current project's triggers

**Solutions:**
- **If trigger disabled:** Run `createAutomatedTrigger()` again
- **If API error:** Check OpenAI API key and credits
- **If Gmail error:** Verify Gmail permissions granted
- **If Sheet error:** Check sheet permissions and ID

**Manual Fix:**
Run `processBidEmails()` manually to process current backlog

#### Issue: Dashboard Shows Error

**Symptoms:**
- Red error banner on dashboard
- "Error loading data" message
- Empty bid cards

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Visit API directly: `/.netlify/functions/getBids`
3. Check Netlify Function logs

**Solutions:**
- **If "Service account error":** Verify environment variable set correctly
- **If "Sheet not found":** Check sheet permissions for service account
- **If "Network error":** Check internet connection, try refresh

#### Issue: Authentication Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Can't log in
- "Email not confirmed" message
- Stuck on login page

**Solutions:**
- **Email not confirmed:**
  - Netlify Dashboard → Identity → Users
  - Click user → Manually confirm
  - Or enable Autoconfirm in settings

- **Forgot password:**
  - Click "Forgot password?" on login page
  - Enter email
  - Check inbox for reset link

- **User not found:**
  - Verify invitation was sent
  - Check spam folder
  - Resend invitation from Netlify Dashboard

#### Issue: AI Miscategorizing Bids

**Symptoms:**
- Relevant bids marked as "Disregard"
- Irrelevant bids marked as "Respond"
- Reasoning doesn't match content

**Solutions:**
1. Review keyword categories - may need updates
2. Check company context accuracy
3. Manually review disregarded bids periodically
4. Adjust AI prompt if patterns emerge
5. Consider using gpt-4 model for better accuracy (higher cost)

**To Update AI Prompt:**
1. Open Google Apps Script
2. Find `COMPANY_CONTEXT` and `CATEGORY_KEYWORDS`
3. Edit as needed
4. Save
5. Test with `testAIAnalysis()`

#### Issue: Duplicate Bids

**Symptoms:**
- Same email processed multiple times
- Duplicate entries in Active_Bids

**Diagnosis:**
Check Processing_Log for "Skipping duplicate" messages

**Prevention:**
System has 4 layers of duplicate prevention (should be rare)

**Manual Fix:**
1. Identify duplicates by Email ID
2. Delete duplicates from Active_Bids tab
3. Ensure Gmail labels applied correctly

### Performance Optimization

#### Reducing API Costs

**OpenAI Usage:**
- Current model: gpt-4o-mini (~$0.002 per bid)
- Monitor usage: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Set spending limits in OpenAI dashboard

**Strategies:**
- Reduce BATCH_SIZE if too many irrelevant emails
- Add Gmail filters to pre-screen emails
- Use shorter DAYS_TO_SEARCH window

#### Improving Response Time

**Dashboard Loading:**
- Data cached in React state
- Use Refresh button only when needed
- Consider adding Redis caching for API (future)

**Function Performance:**
- Currently processes all bids on each request
- Future: Add pagination for large datasets
- Future: Implement incremental updates

### Backup & Recovery

#### Google Sheet Backup

**Automatic:**
- Google Sheets auto-saves
- Version history available: File → Version history

**Manual Export:**
1. File → Download → Excel or CSV
2. Save locally or to cloud storage
3. Recommended: Monthly backups

#### Code Backup

**GitHub Repository:**

### Security Considerations

#### API Keys & Credentials

**OpenAI API Key:**
- ✅ Stored in Google Apps Script Properties (encrypted)
- ✅ Never exposed in code or logs
- ✅ Access via getOpenAIKey() function only

**Google Service Account:**
- ✅ JSON key Base64-encoded in Netlify
- ✅ Never committed to Git
- ✅ Viewer-only access to sheets
- ✅ Separate from personal Google account

**Netlify Identity:**
- ✅ Passwords hashed by Netlify
- ✅ Invite-only registration
- ✅ HTTPS enforced
- ✅ No plaintext credentials stored

#### Data Protection

**Email Data:**
- ✅ Deleted from Gmail after processing
- ✅ Stored in private Google Sheet
- ✅ Sheet shared only with authorized accounts
- ✅ Access controlled via service account

**Personal Information:**
- ℹ️ Email addresses stored (necessary for contact)
- ℹ️ No sensitive personal data collected
- ℹ️ Compliant with business communication standards

**Recommendations:**
1. Regularly rotate OpenAI API key (quarterly)
2. Review Google Sheet permissions monthly
3. Monitor Netlify access logs
4. Use strong passwords for all accounts
5. Enable 2FA on critical accounts (GitHub, Netlify, Google)

#### Vulnerability Monitoring

**Regular Checks:**
- Run `npm audit` monthly
- Update dependencies: `npm update`
- Review Netlify security advisories
- Check Google Apps Script for deprecated APIs

**Current Status:**
- No known vulnerabilities
- All dependencies up-to-date as of Oct 2025
- HTTPS enforced on all connections

### Performance Metrics

#### Current Performance

**Email Processing:**
- Average: 56 emails in 8 minutes
- Rate: ~7 emails/minute
- AI latency: ~1 second per email (with 1s pause)
- Batch size: 50 emails max

**API Response Times:**
- getBids function: 200-500ms average
- With 6 active bids: ~250ms
- With 50 disregarded bids: ~400ms
- Cold start: 1-2 seconds

**Dashboard Load Times:**
- Initial page load: 2-3 seconds
- Data fetch: 200-500ms
- Refresh: 300-600ms
- Optimal for < 100 active bids

#### Scaling Considerations

**Email Volume:**
- Current: ~50-100 emails/day
- Capacity: 300 emails per 4-hour batch
- Daily capacity: 1,800 emails
- Well under limits

**Storage:**
- Google Sheets: 10 million cells limit
- Current usage: ~1,000 cells
- Capacity: 10,000+ bids easily

**API Costs:**
- OpenAI: $0.002 per bid
- 100 bids/day = $6/month
- 1,000 bids/day = $60/month
- Netlify Functions: Free tier sufficient

**Recommended Limits:**
- Active bids: < 500 for optimal dashboard performance
- Archive old bids monthly
- Consider pagination at 1,000+ total bids
