## 📝 **Content Template**

Based on the guidelines, here's a strong post structure:

### **Title** (with keyword)
```
ReFraming for Resilience: Mental Armor Skill That Lasts
```
*Keywords used: ReFraming, Resilience, Mental Armor*

### **Body Structure**

**Opening - Key Takeaway**:
```
Learn how to challenge negative thoughts and improve performance under pressure.
```

**Why It Matters**:
```
Frontline professionals often default to self-doubt. ReFraming helps protect 
confidence and clarity in critical moments. Research shows that resilience training 
focused on cognitive reframing reduces stress by up to 40%.
```

**From the Field**:
```
"I caught myself spiraling after a failed callout. I remembered to ReFrame it 
and walked into my next shift focused and calm." — Firefighter, 8 years experience

Statistics show that first responder wellbeing improves significantly when 
mental fitness tools like ReFrame are practiced regularly.
```

**Main Body** (3-5 paragraphs):
```
ReFrame is the ability to spot unhelpful thoughts and shift your perspective 
to stay aligned with your values, goals, and performance. It's not about blind 
optimism—it's about accurate thinking under pressure.

When we ReFrame, we learn to challenge extreme or unproductive beliefs, ask 
what matters most right now, and create a more useful way of seeing the situation. 
The result? Better decisions, stronger focus, and more effective leadership development.
