## AI Content Generation Patterns

### **Monday: Resilience Skill Spotlight**
**Goal**: Introduce a resilience skill or concept with an engaging question

**Pattern**:
- Hook with relatable workplace/life challenge
- Introduce the skill/concept
- Ask thought-provoking question to audience
- Light on CTA (build awareness)

**Example Prompt Elements**:
- "What skill from Mental Armor curriculum hasn't been featured recently?"
- "What workplace challenge is timely/seasonal?"
- "Craft a question that sparks reflection"

**AI Considerations**:
- Check last 4 Monday posts to avoid repetition
- Align with current events/seasons when relevant
- Focus on universal workplace challenges

---

### **Wednesday: Follow-Up & Deeper Dive**
**Goal**: Build on Monday's topic with deeper insights or practical application

**Pattern**:
- Reference Monday's concept (subtly, not explicitly)
- Provide science-backed insight or real-world example
- Offer 1-2 practical tips or reflection points
- Medium CTA (invite engagement)

**Example Prompt Elements**:
- "Read Monday's post - what was the core concept?"
- "Provide neuroscience or research backing"
- "Give actionable steps to practice the skill"

**AI Considerations**:
- Read most recent Monday post for context
- Add depth without being preachy
- Include evidence/research when possible

---

### **Friday: Call to Action**
**Goal**: Convert the week's engagement into website visits or inquiries

**Pattern**:
- Synthesize Monday + Wednesday themes
- Position 49 North/Mental Armor as the solution
- Strong, clear CTA to website or resource
- Include link and invitation to connect

**Example Prompt Elements**:
- "What problem did Monday/Wednesday highlight?"
- "How does 49 North solve this?"
- "Compelling reason to visit website NOW"

**AI Considerations**:
- Read Monday + Wednesday posts
- Create urgency without being pushy
- Link to www.mymentalarmor.com
- Mention organizational training options
